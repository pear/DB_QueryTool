TODO
- use varibales for the table names, to shorten the queries
  such as SELECT * FROM tableX a1, tableY a2 ...
- implement primaryCol to be capable of using multiple columns   
- set and option which calls autoJoin by itself if a table is not joined, but used 
  in some clause (like in where or select) use only tables from the tableSpec


DONE
